## Description

This program finds available meeting slots for a group of people based on their busy schedules and working periods. It includes intervals where all members are available for at least the minimum required meeting duration, including intervals that are exactly equal to the minimum duration.

## Files

- `Project2_starter.py`: The main Python script containing the algorithm.
- `Input.txt`: Sample input file with schedules and meeting duration.
- `Output.txt`: The output file where the result will be written.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Python 3 installed** on your system.

2. **Place the files in the same directory:**

   - `Project2_starter.py`
   - `Input.txt`
   - `Output.txt` (will be created if it doesn't exist)

3. **Prepare the `Input.txt` file:**

   - Include your test cases in `Input.txt`.
   - Separate different test cases with a blank line.

4. **Run the script using the command:**

   ```bash
   python Project2_starter.py
